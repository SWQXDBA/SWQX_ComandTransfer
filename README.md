# SWQX_ComandTransfer

A Torch plugin for converting commands.
Sometimes we want to set some shortcut instructions.

# For example
!lh, instead of !longhelp
or
!h load instead of! hanger load (although quick instructions are provided in the Quantum hangar plug-in, it is inconvenient to maintain).
# Now,we have a gui to replace all commands.
